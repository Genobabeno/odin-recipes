            <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>

    <h4>
        <strong>Yeast: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <em>
            Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, 
            which means it's the ingredient that causes the 
            pizza dough to rise.
        </em>
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Sugar: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <em>
            To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in
            warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the
            yeast something to eat and speeds up the
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/">activation process</a>.
            You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly
            and frothy on top.

    <h4>
        <strong>Bread Flour: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/"> <em>Bread flour</em></a>
        <em>
            is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates 
            chewier results than all-purpose flour. 
            This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce 
            lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.
        </em>
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Olive Oil: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <em>
            Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: 
            Not only does it add color and flavor, 
            but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. 
            This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
        </em>
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Salt: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <em>
            A little bit of salt goes a long way. 
            Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), 
            and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
