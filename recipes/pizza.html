            <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>

    <h4>
        <strong>Yeast: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, 
            which means it's the ingredient that causes the 
            pizza dough to rise.
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Sugar: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in 
        warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the 
        yeast something to eat and speeds up the 
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/">activation process</a>.
        You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly 
        and frothy on top.

    <h4>
        <strong>Bread Flour: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/"> Bread flour</a>
        is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates 
        chewier results than all-purpose flour. 
        This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce 
        lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Olive Oil: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: 
        Not only does it add color and flavor, 
        but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. 
        This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
    </body>
    <h4>
        <strong>Salt: </strong>
    </h4>
    <body>
        A little bit of salt goes a long way. 
        Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), 
        and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
